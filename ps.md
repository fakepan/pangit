I am Wenhan Wei, from Peking University. My major now is Landscape Architecture and I studied urban planning when I was undergraduate. My GPA is 3.67 in the first year of my graduate study. I am interested in Geography and the courses of my college are mostly based on Geography so I want to apply for Geography.

In the first year of my study, I finished the project "XiNing ecological restoration planning". XiNing is the capital of QingHai province, which is located in the north west of China and suffered from ecological problems such like soil erosion and geological disaster. We use geographical methods to fix the ecological environment problems. Taking minor watershed as the basic unit since it is the basic unit of hydrological process, we divided XiNing city into many pieces and reclassified them as 10 types by 4 features: elevation, terrain, economic mode and human activity. After that, we developed different strategies for each type of minor watershed. I am the manager of this project and I am responsible for making overall roadmap and ideas. When it comes to specific works, I do the research about watershed, use SPSS to find the principle components which affect the watershed more, use ArcGIS to do some basic analysis and draw  the diagrams that express the strategy we designed.

I do a research with 2 partners about the relationships between the colors of the street view and the emotions of the pedestrians. The urbanization process of China is very fast and the urbanization rate is close to 60%. However, there are many problems with the fast urbanization. Most cities are rough and lack exquisite design. In this research, we explore the relationship between street views and people's emotions to provide advices for urban planning. We use "HTC VIVE",  a VR equipment to simulate street views environment and and use 360Â° panoramic camera to collect streew views of different places in Beijing, China. After that, we collect the data of EEG, EDA, and BVP from the subjects  while they are looking around the street views via the VR equipment and conduct simple survey about each test view after they finished the observation. We clean the raw data and processed the data using different methods. Then we use the  color information of the panoramic photos like ratio of different colors and diversity index as independent variables and use data of EEG, EdA, and BVP as the dependent variables to explore their relevance.
