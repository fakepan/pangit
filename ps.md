I am Wenhan Wei, from Peking University. My major now is Landscape Architecture and I studied urban planning when I was undergraduate. My GPA is 3.67 in the first year of my graduate study. I am interested in Geography and the courses of my college are mostly based on Geography so I want to apply for Geography.
