I am Wenhan, a master student from Peking university,majoring in Landscape Architecture currently.I also studied urban planning and architecture when I was undergraduate.Through years’ studies from small scale to large scale,geography has been a common point for me to think and start with,courses in my college are mostly based on geography as well.Therefore I would like to continue my study and  dig more about geography with my previous knowledge in UZH.

In my current postgraduate studies,I have been focusing on urban planing and have finished several researches and projects. These practice helped me to understand what a complete research process is and to gain methods of geography and statistics.

In the project ‘Xining ecological restoration planning’,me and my group used geographical methods to fix ecological environment problems.Xining is the capital city of Qinghai province,suffering from ecological problems such as soil erosion and geological disasters.Taking minor watershed as the basic unit,we divided Xining City into pieces and reclassified them into 10 types by 4 features:elevation,terrain,economic mode and human activity.After that,each watershed type was responded with specific strategy by us.During the process,I worked as the group leader,in  charge of making the overall roadmap, conceiving ideas and doing some specific analysis,for example,using SPSS to find the principle components which affects the watershed more or using ArcGIS to draw diagrams which could show our design strategy. This project is an early one but help me to perceive how geographical analysis could corporate with urban planning and design.

After that, my study came to a more specific stage to understand and analyze cities by using two tpyes of data, big data and new data. Two researches are completed in the last semester using these two kinds of data. 

One of the researches focused on human's psychological and physiological responses to city streetscapes, especially from a color composition perspective. VR equipment and physiological monitoring devices are used to simulate real streetscapes and collect the physiological data from volunteers. The raw data was precessed and be used as the dependent variables while the color data of the panoramic photos like diversity index were used as independent variables to explore the relevance. The work I did in the research was data processing ,data analysis and some review of the EEG and EDA data. It helped me with the quantitative research method and analysis skills. The other research was about the everydayness of cultural herigate, in which big data was used to discover the consumer's group structure and explore the everydayness changes in cultural heritage. Everydayness can be understood as the extent to which cultural heritage is related to daily life. In the context of heritage tourism, many cultural heritages are becoming more and more commercialized and popular for tourists. On the same time, they are gradually separated from daily life and lose their everydayness. Beijing time-honored brands(BTHB) are been taken as examples to explore the transform of the everydayness of the culture heritage since BTHB are the historic heritages of old Beijing city and are closely connected with daily life as well. Data from Dianping.com(same like Yelp) was used to define the index of everydayness and after that we we use methods of spatial clustering and spatial autocorrelation to explore their relevance and influence factors in space. I participated in every process of this research and contributed my thoughts on the selection of the topic and the development of technical routes.

These two studies have tought me the complete processes and methods of indenpendent research and also remind me that there are still many aspects to improve, especially in geographical thinking. Data and analysis are just tools to solving problems, but the spatial and geographical thinking behind is the key to solving the problems. The result of the first research could be wildly applied to the entire city if it can be considered from a geographical perspective and clustering the photos of streetscapes. When it comes to human geography, theories and methods could be more abstract and need a deeper understanding of concepts. The research about everydayness can not go deeper because there is no complete theoretical framework to suport the research and the methods we used are not appropriate. 

With the further development of learning and research, I am increasingly aware of the importance of geography. In the Chinese education system, Urban Planning have two disciplines, one based on Architecture and the other based on Geography. In my undergraduate study, I accepted the architecture-based urban planning education, which pays more attention to the grasp of spatial form. However, I find out that I lack the analytical ability to solve problems at the regional level, and I don't know enough about scientific analytical methods and knowledge system. 

To understand the city from a more scientific and effective perspective, the study of geography is imminent and I really want to learn that in UZH since the curriculum is very suitable for me. There are many subjects in Geography and the Human Geography can meet my needs. Lectures about Qualitative Methodologies and Methods could provide me the basic social-science-bases methods and help me develop and conduct my own social-science-bases empirical research projects. Other lectures about technology like Spatial Analysis can improve my skills of analysis and make it easier to do my own research.

In addition to academic considerations, I also want to experience different lifestyles. Zurich is a beautiful city and I love the culture and history there. Also I want to learn German and improve my English.

Thanks very much for this opportunity and I would appreciate it a lot if I can gain the chance to study in UZH.











~~In my postgraduate stage, I want to better understand the city from a geographical perspective and cultivate my own geographical  thinking.~~

~~After that, my study came to a more specific stage because data was used as analysis device to assist urban planning.Nowadays the urbanization process of China is fast as its rate is close to 60%. However fast the urbanization is,most city cannot keep up with the relevant level of urban planning and lack exquisite urban design.Therefore me and my partners carried out a research about the relationship between the color of street view and the emotion of pedestrians and how the analysis could help urban planning.We used "HTC VIVE", a VR equipment to simulate street views environment and a 360° panoramic camera to collect street views of different places in Beijing, China. After that, we collected the data of EEG, EDA, and BVP from the subjects while they are looking around the street views via the VR equipment and conduct simple survey about each test view after they finished the observation.Then we cleaned the raw data and processed it using different [methods.In](methods.In) the process,color information of the panoramic photos~~







~~"HTC VIVE", a VR equipment to simulate street views environment and a 360° panoramic camera to collect street views of different places in Beijing, China.  in which me and my 2 partners using new data such as EEG and EDA waves generated by ortable brain wave equipment and wearable device.~~







~~and two researches are completed using big data or other new data as analysis devices to assist urban planning. 这两个研究让我掌握了独立研究的基本流程和基本的研究方法，但我也发现了我在研究中面临着巨大的问题。数据只是研究的工具，而地理学的知识能让我的研究更好。在感知的研究中，如果我可以增加空间分析的部分，利用机器学习将实验结果推广到整个地理空间，这将是巨大的改进。而在第二个研究中，我发现这个研究需要很多人文地理方面的知识和思维方式.~~
